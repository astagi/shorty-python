Access many URL shortening services from one library.

Supported URL shortening services for shrinking long urls:
    sandbox (stored locally in memory for testing)
    tinyurl.com
    tr.im
    urlborg.com
    bit.ly
    is.gd
    cli.gs
    twurl.nl (tweetburner)
    digg.com
    a.gd
    buk.me
    fon.gs
    fwd4.me
    chilp.it

Shorty can expand any url service by getting the redirect
location by requesting the tiny url.

See example.py for a demo of using this library.

Language: Python
Website: http://gitorious.org/shorty
Repository: git://gitorious.org/shorty/python.git
Requirements:
    Python 2.4+
    Simplejson (not required in python 2.6+)

Build:
    Each URL service is implemented in its own module inside the services
    folder. To use this library you must compile all the various modules together.
    To compile you will use the compile.py script. Here is its usage:

        python compile.py <services>

    <services> is a space seperated list of the services you want included.
    If you wish to use all supported services use the --all flag instead.
    After the script runs a file named 'shorty.py' will appear.
    A copy of the full shorty.py module will be kept in this repository.

Install:
    Simply include the shorty.py module in your python path.
    If using a version of python before 2.6 you will also need
    to have simplejson installed.
